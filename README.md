# mpgadget_viz_notebooks

Notebooks for simple visualizations for MP-Gadget simulations using Gaepsi2 (https://github.com/rainwoodman/gaepsi2). The tutorial is modified from yueyingn's notebook.

You can find MP-Gadget simulations here: http://github.com/MP-Gadget/MP-Gadget/

To find simulation output, navigate to the `output` directory. Particle position data is stored within `output/PARTXXX/`, where `XXX` represents the simulation's snapshot number. These numbers correlate with different stages in cosmic evolution, with higher numbers indicating latter phase of the Universe. To understand the relationship between redshift and snapshot numbers, refer to the `output/Snapshots.`txt for a detailed conversion table.

For the learning purpose, you can use my simulation file which I put on the google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ygmwjg_TT9qAgArnIUP1ZquuinlcyOCf?usp=share_link), this is a simulation with 128^3 particles (dark matter + gas particles) and in 60 cMpc/h box size. I only put the PART folder for the last snapshot.
